<img style="float:right" width="70" src="./gopher.png"> Go bluetooth API for Linux-based Bluez DBus interface.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth)


## Bluez API versioning

The version on master tracks Ubuntu bluetoothd version (v5.64). There are dedicated branches/tags with various version

- [bluez 5.60](https://github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth)
- [bluez 5.62](https://github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth/tree/bluez-5.62)
- [bluez 5.63](https://github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth/tree/bluez-5.63)
- [bluez 5.64](https://github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth/tree/bluez-5.64)
- [bluez 5.65](https://github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth/tree/bluez-5.65)

See branches for available versions.

## Features

The library is a wrapper to the Bluez DBus API and some high level API to ease the interaction.

High level features supported:

- [x] Client code generation from bluez documentation
- [x] Shell wrappers for `rfkill`, `btmgmt`, `hciconfig`, `hcitool`
- [x] An `hci` socket basic API (inspired by [go-ble/ble](https://github.com/go-ble/ble))
- [x] Expose bluetooth service from go code [*unstable*]
- [x] Pairing and authentication support (via agent)
- [x] Beaconing send & receive (iBeacon and Eddystone)
- [x] Mesh API support (since v5.53)

## Todo

- [ ] Generate dbus-compatible XML from documentation
- [ ] Generate mock service to test the library against

## Using this library

- [TinyGo bluetooth](https://github.com/tinygo-org/bluetooth)
- [pi-wifi](https://github.com/gitchander/pi-wifi)

## Running examples

Examples are available in `_examples` folder.

```sh
cd _examples
go run main.go
# print available example commands
# Example discovery
go run main.go discovery
```

## Development setup

1. Clone the repository

  `git clone https://github.com/gitchander/go-bluetooth.git`

1. Retrieve the bluetooth API and generate GO code

  ```sh
  make bluez/init bluez/checkout gen/clean gen/run
  ```

## Code generation

To generate code for a new version of bluez use the command

`BLUEZ_VERSION=5.65 make gen/clean gen`

Change to a version available in bluez. Note that generated code may be broken or incomplete and the generation script may need fine tuning.

### How generation works

The code structure follow this pattern:

 - `./api` contains wrappers for the DBus Api
 - `./bluez` contains the actual implementation, generated from the `bluez` documentation

Use `make gen` to re-generate go sources. There is also a commodity bluez JSON file available in the root folder for reference.

Generated code has `gen_` prefix. If an API file exists with the same filename but _without_ the prefix, generation will be skipped for that API.

## Requirements

The library is tested with

- golang `1.17.5`
- bluez bluetooth `v5.50`, `v5.54`, `v5.60`

### Development notes

- Inspect a service ObjectManager

  ```shell
  dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=go.bluetooth /hci0/apps/0 org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager.GetManagedObjects
  ```

- Retrieve char properties

  ```
  dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=go.bluetooth /hci0/apps/0/service000003e8/char0  org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll string:org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
  ```

-   Give access to `hciconfig` to any user and avoid `sudo` (may have [security implications](https://www.insecure.ws/linux/getcap_setcap.html))

    ```
    sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' `which hciconfig`
    ```
- Monitor Bluetooth activity

  `sudo btmon`

- Monitor DBus activity

    `sudo dbus-monitor --system "type=error"`

- Start `bluetoothd` with experimental features and verbose debug messages `make bluetoothd`

- Enable LE advertisement (on a single pc ensure to use at least 2x bluetooth adapter)

  ```bash

    sudo btmgmt -i 0 power off
    sudo btmgmt -i 0 name "my go app"
    sudo btmgmt -i 0 le on    
    sudo btmgmt -i 0 connectable on
    sudo btmgmt -i 0 advertising on
    sudo btmgmt -i 0 power on

  ```
